  Only verified users can vote.

(Terminology note: All instances of requirements/criteria being tied or fixed to others are bolded, so if one changes we know what else goes with it.)

<!--If X is fixed to Y, then a rule changing the requirements for Y automatically changes X; for instance, if the requirement for promotion changes to twenty votes, then the number of votes required for removal will automatically change with it.-->

    <li><p>Standard rule proposals require 3 votes to be enacted. These can change a variety of things, including the rules themselves.</p></li>
    <li><p>Permanent rule proposals are approved in a tally vote which lasts 36 hours. Ties prevent it passing. Permanent rules take precedence over standard rules.</p></li>

<h3>Manager Reapproval</h3>

<table id="normal">
  <ul>
    <li><p>Managers must be re-approved every three months. The criteria for re-approval will be the same as (are fixed to) the criteria for initial approval. The re-approval period will last for one week (168 hours) from the time the vote for re-approval is posted, after which all managers who don't meet the criteria for re-approval will lose the Manager badge and capabilities. This will also apply to inactive managers. Banned managers lose their Manager badge when they are banned.</p></li>
    
    <p>This will be carried out most likely through a thread posted in the Manager Elections category by an admin or someone else. This thread should be labeled with "manager re-approval" and the date; it should be categorized as a discussion. Each individual manager can post a comment and some variation on "I'd like re-approval", or the admins or others can post one comment for each manager listing their name. A heart/like on a top-level comment is considered a vote to re-approve that manager, and, if the number of votes noted above is reached, that manager is re-approved.
    </p>
    <p>Re-approval happens on the first day of the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months (March, June, September, December).
    </p> 
  </ul>

<a name="banvotes"></a>
<h2>Bans</h2>

<p>To ban a user, a vote must be held. The user that initiates the vote must create a post in the appropriate forum with the user to be banned and the reasons for the ban.</p>

<h3>Manager-Initiated</h3>

<p>In order to implement the ban, a number of votes is required; this number is fixed to the same number of votes as a manager election, currently 5. (Not counting the manager who proposes it.)
</p>


<h3>User-Initiated</h3>

<p> A regular DC user can also start a ban petition; this is fixed to two votes more than an admin-initiated ban, currently 7. (Not counting the user who proposes it.)
</p>
<br>
<a name="otherresolutions"></a>

<h2>Other Resolutions</h2>

<p>(Not all of these are implemented rules, more like meta discussions about how we should act.)
</p>

<p>Debate categories are generally done through #hashtags.</p>
<p>Votes for rule proposals are done through comments saying "support", "I agree", "I vote for this", or something of the like. Hearts/likes do not count as votes (except when stated otherwise, such as for manager re-approval).</p>
<p>Inappropriate comments/topics should have a warning like "//nsfw" at the start.</p>
<p>There are two pathways to joining DC (besides having been on DC Scratch): Join Scratch and earn the Scratcher status or know a DC Scratch member IRL. When  a new member requests verification, they should either name who they know IRL or link your Scratch account. Then, the person they know IRL should verify it or someone should check the Scratch account.</p>
